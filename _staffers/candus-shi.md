Howdy y'all, I'm Candus, a third-year majoring in data science, minoring in math, and I'm from Santa Cruz ðŸ¤™! I enjoy learning/teaching the concepts in DSC 40Aâ€”it helped me make my decision to minor in mathâ€”so I am stoked to be tutoring again. In my free time I enjoy knitting, playing jazz piano, and golfing. Looking forward to meeting y'all ðŸ˜Ž!
