Hello everyone! My name is Yuxin, you can also call me Emily. I'm in my senior year, majoring in Data Science and Math-CS. When I'm not studying, I love engaging in various activities like cooking, swimming, surfing, and especially spending time with my two cats üê±‚Äîone domestic and the other a Siberian. Feel free to drop by during my office hours. I'm looking forward to meeting you all!
