Hello, I'm Aobo (pronounced "obo") and I'm excited to be instructing DSC40A during the upcoming winter term! I a new faculty at HDSI & the Department of Physics. I earned my Bachelor of Science from the University of Washington, Seattle, and my PhD from Boston University, both in the field of physics. I made the leap to sunny San Diego in September 2023 and just dived into teaching. My research is centered on utilizing machine learning techniques to squeeze out the maximum amount of information from ultra-sensitive radiation detectors, all in the quest to uncover elusive particles like neutrinos and dark matters. The connection between physics and data science is fascinating: in physics we translate natural phenomena into data through meticulously designed experiments and leverage "learning from data" to advance our comprehension of physics. DSC40A is dedicated to exploring how we can employ "learning from data" methodologies to tackle real-world challenges. Beyond academia, my interests span from following e-sports to exploring national parks and cityscapes.
