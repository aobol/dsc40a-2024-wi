<p>Hello, I'm Aobo (pronounced "obo") and I'm excited to be instructing DSC40A during the winter term! I am a new faculty at HDSI & the Department of Physics. I earned my B.S. from UW Seattle and my PhD from Boston University, both in the field of physics. My research uses machine learning to squeeze out the maximum amount of information from ultra-sensitive radiation detectors, all in the quest to uncover elusive neutrinos/dark matters.

 The connections between physics and data science always fascinate me: In physics, we translate nature's message into data through meticulously designed experiments, and then "learning from data" to advance our physics knowledge. DSC40A will teach you how to "learn from data" to tackle real-world challenges. Beyond academia, my interests span from following e-sports to exploring national parks and photography.</p>
