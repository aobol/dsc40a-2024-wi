Hi everyone! My name is Yujia(Joy), and I’m a fourth-year student double majoring in Data Science and Math&Econ. I was born and raised in China for the first fourteen years of my life, then my family moved to San Diego. This is my fourth time tutoring a data science class, and it’s my fourth time to tutor DSC 40A, I am really excited to tutor for DSC 40A again, and I am willing to provide as much help as possible to everyone in this class. I look forward to meeting you all, and please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns!
