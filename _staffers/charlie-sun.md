Hello! My name is Charlie, I'm a second-year majoring in Data Science. I like rap, poker, and f1. This is my second time tutoring DSC40A - to be honest it wasn't my favorite class as a student, but the more pieces I put together, the more I began to appreciate its charm and importance. The concepts in this class are actually super helpful (especially for when I play poker), so I really hope you could feel the same way as I did, and we'll try our best to help you on this journey!
