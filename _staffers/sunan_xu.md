Hi, my name is Sunan. I am a third-year student majoring in bioinformatics and data science. I was born in China and before moving to San Diego, I spent four years in Nashville for my high school education. I have tutored DSC 30 and 80 before, but this is my first time tutoring DSC 40. I am really excited since DSC 40 is my favorite among the DSC courses, as it explains some interesting mathematical ideas behind coding.
