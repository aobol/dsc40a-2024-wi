Hi, I am a second-year master's student from the ECE department. I graduate from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen with a bachelor degree in Data Science. My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and information theory. I am excited to participate in teaching an introductory machine learning course. Please feel free to discuss any topics you find interesting in this field.
