Hi everyone! I am Vivian, and I am a 4th year Data Science major with a Business minor. My hometown is Saratoga, CA. In my free time, I love to play tennis, go to the beach, read, and explore San Diego with friends! A fun fact about me is I have performed Irish dancing for a Golden State Warriors' halftime show before. This is my fifth time tutoring DSC 40A, so I am super excited to meet you all and answer any questions you guys may have! Feel free to stop my OH whenever, even if it's just to say hi!
